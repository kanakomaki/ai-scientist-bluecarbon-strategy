# **🌍 Agentic AI for Navigating Blue Carbon Credit Strategy - AI Scientist**

## Overview
This repository presents a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) AI system designed to support **blue carbon credit strategy** planning using mangrove ecosystems in the Philippines. It was developed to integrate scientific experiments, institutional reasoning, and LLM-based report writing.

This PoC represents an intersection of **"AI" x "Ocean Science" x "Policy"** demonstrating how LLMs can support environmentally aligned strategic planning, appying [AI Scientist-V2](https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist-v2)'s strong capability in scientific logic making and writing. 

## Main PoC setting: 
Assist Japanese Small & Mid sized Enterprises in evaluating and initiating mangrove-based blue carbon projects by combining environmental analysis and social strategy using LLM agents.

## Key Features

- Agent-like modular design with full reproducibility

- LLM-guided idea generation

- Science experiments by choice

- Not only science! Social data is analyzed in the framework

- LLM-generated scientific formula LaTeX report 

- LLM-reviewed contents including reflection loops

## How to Run
<img src="schematic_flow.png" alt="Function flow" width="500">

### Set up conda environment
As some external model requires dependency difficult libraries with venv and pip, I applied conda.
```python
# something like this
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mangrove
```
### Prepare models and input data

- templates/predict_mangrove/models/ must contain pre-trained model or will run as untrained
- templates/*/inputs/ must include typhoon CSV and satellite images

### Launch full PoC pipeline
- python launch_aiscientist.py
```
This will:
- Generate ideas
- Run all 3 experiments
- Combine results into figures + summaries
- Create a scientific PDF report via LLM + VLM
```
## Output Example
- Final LLM-written PDF: experiments_outputs/combined_*/template.pdf

- Generated figures: combined_figures/

- Descriptive summary: combined_summary.md



## Models Used

- LLM: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct for usual generation, anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet for write-up (both via OpenRouter)

- VLM: openai/gpt-4-vision-nano for image interpretation

- External models:  [MangroveClassification repository](https://github.com/nkinnaird/MangroveClassification), [TYPHOONTRACK2GRIDPOINT repository](https://github.com/rodekruis/TYPHOONTRACK2GRIDPOINT#)

- GraphDB: NetworkX for stakeholder modeling
