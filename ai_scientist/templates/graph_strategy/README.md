## graph strategy (social experiment)

### This is an original experiment code by myself to analyze the current situtaions and best options on the regulatory and social schemes for our potential client to achieve their blue carbon acquision goals. 

### Data Preparation
#### data folder
- templates/graph_strategy/inputs/ 
- ".graphhml file" that is made by the previous step with "perform_experiments_social_db.py" is required.
- You can create your own social map data in graphhml with you own knowledge as well.
- The more detailed and deeper knowledge based on local/international points of views in Carbon Crediting and Environmental management will be a big plus for this analysis. 

#### output folder
- experiments_outputs/graph_strategy/
- "focused_graph.png" is an output figure of the stakeholder map around the client
- "result_summary.md" is another output of the summary of this analysis
