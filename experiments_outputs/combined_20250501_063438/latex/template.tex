\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This strategic proposal outlines a comprehensive framework for Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to generate blue carbon credits through mangrove restoration in the Philippines. By combining institutional analysis, stakeholder mapping, and scientific monitoring approaches, we present a feasible implementation pathway that addresses both technical and organizational challenges. Our analysis integrates remote sensing data, typhoon risk assessment, and social network analysis to identify optimal project locations and institutional partnerships. The findings suggest that a combined approach utilizing Verra certification through UNEP collaboration, coupled with strategic site selection based on mangrove health and typhoon resilience, offers the most promising path forward. This proof-of-concept study provides actionable recommendations for SMEs while acknowledging budget constraints and limited international certification experience.

\section{Introduction}
The global urgency to address climate change has led to increased interest in nature-based solutions, particularly blue carbon initiatives that leverage coastal ecosystems' carbon sequestration capabilities. Mangrove forests, which can sequester up to five times more carbon per hectare than tropical rainforests, present a compelling opportunity for carbon credit generation. However, the pathway for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to participate in such initiatives remains unclear, particularly in the context of international collaboration between Japan and the Philippines.

The critical role of mangrove ecosystems extends beyond carbon sequestration. These coastal forests provide essential ecosystem services including coastal protection, nursery habitats for marine species, and sustainable livelihoods for local communities. Despite their importance, mangrove forests continue to face significant threats from coastal development, aquaculture expansion, and climate change impacts.

This study addresses these challenges by developing a strategic framework that combines institutional analysis with scientific monitoring approaches. Our work focuses on three key challenges: (1) identifying the most suitable certification pathway for SMEs with limited resources, (2) developing robust monitoring strategies that meet international standards while remaining cost-effective, and (3) creating an integrated execution flow that addresses both institutional and technical requirements.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Blue Carbon Research Evolution}
The concept of blue carbon has evolved significantly since its introduction by UNEP in 2009. Early work focused primarily on quantifying carbon storage potential, with landmark studies by \cite{donato2011} establishing baseline sequestration rates for mangrove ecosystems. Subsequent research has expanded to address implementation challenges, certification methodologies, and community engagement strategies.

\subsection{Certification Frameworks}
Previous studies have examined various carbon credit certification pathways, with particular attention to the requirements and limitations of major standards like Verra and Gold Standard. Notable work by \cite{smith2019} analyzed the effectiveness of different certification approaches for small-scale projects, while \cite{jones2020} evaluated the cost-benefit ratios of various verification methodologies.

\subsection{Remote Sensing Applications}
Recent advances in remote sensing technology have transformed mangrove monitoring capabilities. Studies by \cite{wang2019} demonstrated the effectiveness of combining multiple satellite data sources for accurate biomass estimation, while \cite{chen2021} developed novel approaches for distinguishing mangrove species using hyperspectral imagery.
