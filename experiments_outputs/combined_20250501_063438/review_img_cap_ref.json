        "Img_description": "The figure is a geographic heatmap showing maximum wind speeds around Cebu, with colored grid cells or points indicating wind speed intensity. The axes are labeled 'Latitude' and 'Longitude', with a color bar legend showing wind speeds in meters per second. Contour lines are also present, possibly indicating geographic or elevation features, overlaid on a simplified map outline of Cebu and surrounding waters.",
        "Img_review": "The heatmap effectively visualizes areas of high wind speeds, aligning with the caption's focus on typhoon vulnerability. The use of color gradients helps identify regions at greater risk. However, the figure could be improved by adding a more detailed geographic context, such as a scale bar or recognizable landmarks. The color bar might benefit from explicit numeric labels at key points for clarity. The resolution of grid cells and data sources are not specified, which limits reproducibility. Overall, the figure is clear but would benefit from additional contextual annotations and methodological details to enhance interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption succinctly describes the figure as a maximum wind speed heatmap around Cebu, indicating vulnerability to typhoons. It is concise and accurate but could be improved by including a brief note on the data source, time frame, or methodology to provide more context. The current caption effectively summarizes the main purpose but lacks detail that could help interpret the figure's significance more fully.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are indicated as empty brackets, suggesting missing or incomplete citations. Proper integration of references discussing the data or the significance of the wind speed distribution would help contextualize the figure within the paper's broader argument. Currently, the references do not adequately explain or connect to the figure, which diminishes the figure's interpretability in the manuscript."

    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "A square map displaying NDVI values across a geographic region, with a color bar ranging from -1.0 (red) to 1.0 (green). The map shows spatial variation in vegetation health, with greener areas indicating dense, healthy vegetation, and reddish areas indicating sparse or unhealthy vegetation. The axes are unlabeled, and there are no geographic overlays or annotations.",
        "Img_review": "The visualization effectively portrays NDVI data, which aligns with the caption's description. However, the figure lacks axis labels, a clear title, and geographic context, which would aid interpretation. Including a legend explaining the color scheme in more detail, or overlaying geographic features, would enhance clarity. The color range from -1 to 1 correctly represents NDVI values, but without explicit labels or annotations, the specific regions and their significance are less clear. The overall layout is straightforward, but adding contextual information would improve usability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption accurately describes the figure as an NDVI visualization of mangrove health, emphasizing areas of high vegetation density. It is concise but could benefit from a slight expansion to clarify that the color gradient indicates vegetation density and to specify the geographic area or purpose of the visualization. As it stands, it effectively summarizes the figure but could be more informative.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text citation is missing, so it is unclear if the figure is properly integrated or referenced. When included, the figure should be explicitly described in terms of its significance, what it shows, and how it supports the study. Without this context, the figure's role in the narrative is underdeveloped."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "A network diagram showing stakeholder relationships in the blue carbon credit market. The nodes are labeled with stakeholder categories such as government agencies, NGOs, financial institutions, local communities, and specific organizations. Nodes are color-coded: blue for general stakeholders, red for key players, with lines indicating relationships or interactions among them. The layout appears force-directed, with clusters of interconnected stakeholders and peripheral nodes.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively visualizes stakeholder relationships but lacks a legend or explanatory notes on node colors and edge meanings, which reduces clarity. The font size for labels may be small for easy reading. The network's structure highlights central actors (possibly the red nodes), but without explicit labels or legend, interpretations are limited. Including a legend, larger labels, or annotations would enhance comprehension. The overall layout is appropriate for such networks, but adding highlighting or labels for key stakeholders would improve interpretability.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption correctly identifies the figure as a stakeholder network map and notes that it highlights key players and relationships. However, it is somewhat generic and could be more informative by briefly mentioning what the key players are or what the network structure reveals about the blue carbon credit market. Including a concise insight or takeaway would strengthen its usefulness. The caption is appropriately concise but could benefit from a small expansion for clarity.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The provided text indicates the figure is referenced in the main manuscript, but without seeing the actual in-text citations or explanations, it is difficult to assess their adequacy. Ideally, the main text should describe the significance of the network, highlight key stakeholders, and interpret the relationships shown. If such explanations are missing or superficial, the figure's purpose and insights are underexplained. Ensuring the figure is well-integrated with detailed commentary in the main text would improve understanding."
