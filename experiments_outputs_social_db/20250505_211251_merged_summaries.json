The framework is subject to applicability conditions, and the project must comply with the conditions of the applied modules and tools. The framework includes sections on definitions, applicability conditions, project boundary, baseline scenario, additionality, quantification of estimated GHG emission reductions and removals, and monitoring.",
        "application_methods": "The application methods for the REDD+ Methodology Framework include the use of modules and tools to construct a project-specific methodology. The framework provides a decision tree to determine the baseline scenario, and the project must demonstrate additionality using either a barrier analysis or an investment analysis. The framework also includes procedures for determining the project boundary, carbon pools, and sources of GHG emissions.",
        "main_targets": "The main targets of the REDD+ Methodology Framework include avoiding unplanned deforestation, avoiding planned deforestation, conserving intact wetlands, and restoring wetland ecosystems. The framework also includes procedures for determining the baseline scenario, and the project must demonstrate additionality and quantify estimated GHG emission reductions and removals.",

        "conditions_to_get_credits": "The conditions to get credits for the REDD+ Methodology Framework include demonstrating additionality, quantifying estimated GHG emission reductions and removals, and complying with the applicability conditions of the framework and the applied modules and tools. The project must also establish a monitoring plan and report on the project's progress.",
        "expected_periods": "The expected periods for the REDD+ Methodology Framework include a project crediting period of between 20 and 100 years, and a baseline validity period as set out in the VCS Standard. The framework also includes procedures for determining the Peat Depletion Time (PDT) and Soil Organic Carbon Depletion Time (SDT), which may be relevant to the project's crediting period.",
        "expected_difficulty": "The expected difficulty of the REDD+ Methodology Framework is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, but the framework includes complex procedures for determining the baseline scenario, quantifying estimated GHG emission reductions and removals, and monitoring and reporting. The framework also requires the project to demonstrate additionality and comply with applicability conditions, which may be challenging.",
