The framework is subject to the following applicability conditions, noting that the project must also comply with the applicability conditions of the applied modules and tools. The framework includes sections on definitions and acronyms, applicability conditions, project boundary, baseline scenario, additionality, quantification of estimated GHG emission reductions and removals, and monitoring.",
        "application_methods": "The application methods for the REDD+ Methodology Framework involve selecting the appropriate modules and tools to construct a project-specific methodology. The justification of the choice of modules and why they are applicable to the proposed project activity must be given in the project description (PD). The framework includes decision trees and options for demonstrating additionality, such as the VT0001 investment analysis and barrier analysis.",
        "main_targets": "The main targets of the REDD+ Methodology Framework are to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, and to promote sustainable land use practices. The framework applies to various types of REDD+ project activities, including avoiding unplanned deforestation, avoiding planned deforestation, conservation of intact wetlands, and restoring wetland ecosystems.",
        "stakeholder_names": "The stakeholders involved in the REDD+ Methodology Framework include project proponents, investors, and verifiers. The framework requires the involvement of these stakeholders in the development and implementation of the project, including the selection of modules and tools, the demonstration of additionality, and the monitoring and reporting of project activities.",
        "available_fundings": "The available fundings for REDD+ projects under the Verra program include carbon credits generated from the project activities, which can be sold to buyers. The framework also includes provisions for buffer withholding percentages to cover non-permanence related project risks.",
        "conditions_to_get_credits": "The conditions to get credits for REDD+ projects under the Verra program include demonstrating additionality, establishing a baseline scenario, and monitoring and reporting project activities. The framework requires project proponents to provide evidence of the project's eligibility and to comply with the applicability conditions of the framework.",
        "expected_periods": "The expected periods for REDD+ projects under the Verra program range from 20 to 100 years. The project crediting period is the period of time for which GHG emission reductions or removals generated by the project are eligible for crediting with the VCS Program.",
        "expected_difficulty": "The expected difficulty of implementing the REDD+ Methodology Framework depends on various factors, including the complexity of the project activities, the availability of data and resources, and the level of stakeholder engagement. The framework requires project proponents to demonstrate a robust understanding of the methodology and its application.",
        "expected_costs": "The expected costs of implementing the REDD+ Methodology Framework include the costs of developing and implementing the project, as well as the costs of monitoring and reporting project activities. The framework requires project proponents to provide a detailed budget and financial plan as part of the project description.",
        "pros_and_cons": "The pros of the REDD+ Methodology Framework include its ability to promote sustainable land use practices, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and generate carbon credits. The cons include the complexity of the framework, the need for significant resources and expertise, and the potential risks and uncertainties associated with project implementation.",
        "Advantages_in_Japanese_applicants": "The advantages of the REDD+ Methodology Framework for Japanese applicants include the potential to generate carbon credits, promote sustainable land use practices, and contribute to Japan's climate change mitigation efforts. Japanese applicants may also benefit from the framework's flexibility and adaptability to different project types and scales.",
        "other_notes": "Other notes on the REDD+ Methodology Framework include the importance of ensuring the accuracy and transparency of project data, the need for ongoing monitoring and reporting, and the potential for the framework to be applied to other types of land use projects. The framework also includes provisions for the use of expert judgment and the selection of key parameters and input data."

The designated geographical boundary should not be changed, and any natural increase in carbon stocks in the concerned area should not be convertible into credits.",
