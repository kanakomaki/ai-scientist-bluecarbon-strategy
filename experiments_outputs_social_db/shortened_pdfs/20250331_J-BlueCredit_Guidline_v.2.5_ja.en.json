    "Q 17: To what level must a credited site be maintained? A 17. ·Credit certification is the result of rehabilitation activities and maintenance management, and is based on the certification period (project period). Maintenance after the project implementation period is not directly related to the credits generated. However, the purpose of the J Blue Credit Scheme is to \"provide voluntary activities for mitigating and adapting to climate change.\" The purpose of the project is to \"continue or develop the activity,\" so \"acquiring credits will lead to the maintenance or development of the activity.\" Please note that the requirement states that \"the ·In addition, through proper maintenance,Q15As stated in the previous article, this will lead to the creation of credits in the following fiscal year.

On the other hand, for example, in the case of activities that allow for continuous credit generation, the transfer of those credits It is anticipated that the funds obtained will be used to cover maintenance activity costs. ·Since you can apply for the same scope of activities every year, it is possible to plan your budget accordingly.

Research and development of the technologies (methodologies) required for *A technology research association is established with ministerial approval under the Technology Research Association Act in order for multiple companies, universities, etc. to conduct joint testing and research. It is a corporation. It has the following features: 1) Equipment acquired through levies can be denominated in abbreviated form for tax purposes, 2) If certain conditions are met, patent fees and other fees can be reduced or  exempted, and 3) A smooth organizational transition to a joint-stock company or similar can be made. Q 11. What kind of organization is JBE (Japan Blue Economy Technology Research Association)? A 11. ·Developing the technologies necessary to revitalize blue economy businesses, such as ocean conservation, restoration, and utilization. As an organization responsible for system design and technical guidance,2year7Currently, Blue Carbon Cloud is We are responsible for the certification, issuance, management and trading of J Blue Credits, which are the core of the credit system. ·J.B.E.The \"Study Group on the Role of Blue Carbon in Contributing to the Prevention of Global Warming\" was established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
