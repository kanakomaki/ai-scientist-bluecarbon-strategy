    "1.  Introduction (Background and Purpose)  The COVID-19 pandemic inflicted heavy damage on our society and economy in 2020. In the field of  climate change, the 26th UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), which had been planned to be  held in Glasgow, United Kingdom, in November 2020, was postponed for a year, thereby also affecting  the preparation for the Paris Agreement agreed in 2015. While various initiatives are taking place  throughout the world for recovery from the pandemic, on the other hand, the “Green Recovery”  movement has also been spreading, mainly in the EU. This is an approach of addressing environmental  issues and economic recovery in parallel for a post-COVID-19 world, which is also expected to achieve  faster implementation of climate change measures in the future. One of the climate change measures  is carbon market mechanisms, which are stipulated in the Paris Agreement and are expected to be  used widely. Japan started the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) in 2013 as its original approach. JCM  is a system used to achieve the reduction targets of Japan. This is done by introducing our excellent  technologies, such as low-carbon technologies and products, throughout developing countries,  promoting the implementation of climate change measures, and making quantitative evaluation of  Japanʼs contribution to GHG reduction and sequestration resulting from such efforts.  The first thing to be defined in the JCM Project Cycle is methodology. Methodology is a document  serving as a foundation to clarify the scope covered by the project to be implemented and  appropriately calculate the produced emission reduction for acquiring credits. This Guidebook outlines  the concept of developing the methodology, the entire cycle, and the procedures for implementation.  Considerations were given when creating this Guidebook so that the content is easily comprehensible  for those who wish to apply for a project of the Financing Programme for JCM Model Projects  (representative business operator candidates, etc.), those who applied for a project and obtained  approval, and all other project proponents (business operators) who will use the JCM system and  conduct their business. Methodology itself is developed mainly by supporting organizations, while  project proponents (business operators) play a main role in running the business. Please use this  Guidebook to understand the mechanism of the methodology and make your business operations  even smoother.  *“Readerʼs guide” is available at the bottom of the page for your reference.  *The procedures for crediting GHG emission reductions (JCM Project Cycle) are defined separately from the cycle for Financing  Programme for JCM Model Projects for each introduced technology explained in this Guideline.",
    "Summary   In order for JCM to be recognized internationally as GHG reduction credits, the  methods and procedures regarding implementation need to be established as a  methodology based on a scientific basis, etc. and announced expressly  beforehand.   The JCM Project Cycle is designed to calculate emission credits, separately from  the procedures for Financing Programme for JCM Model Projects.   Methodology development is the first step to the JCM Project Cycle.   Emission reduction in JCM is calculated by subtracting project emissions from  reference emissions.   In JCM that sees the securing of net emission reduction as important, the key  point is to calculate reference emissions that conservatively figure out  emissions.",
    "Column̶ Net Emission Reduction  JCM performed in accordance with the requirements in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement is  designed to ensure net emission reduction in order to make sure of environmental integrity  defined in the decision. Net emission reduction is a concept that does not credit reduction  from BaU (business as usual) emissions (CDM is based on this concept), but credits lower  reduction than that to ensure substantive emission reduction. This is because, if reduction  from BaU (business as usual) emissions is issued as credits, emitters who acquired the  credits actually produce GHG emissions equivalent to that amount by using the credits, which  does not contribute to reduction on a global scale (see the figure at upper part). In JCM, the  difference between conservatively set reference emissions and project emissions is credited  to ensure net emission reduction that is substantive GHG emission reduction. This effort is  expected to achieve lower GHG emissions on a global scale (see the chart below)."

    "3.2 Development and Approval Process for a New Methodology (②b in fig. 3.1)  If no approved methodologies exist, a new methodology needs to be developed. In this case, the  project proponent and the supporting organization work together to develop a new methodology in  accordance with the sequence indicated below. Specifically, the supporting organization drafts a  methodology, while the project proponent provides necessary information, coordinates with local  stakeholders, and gives technical advice. It will take several months to a year from the start of  development to approval (see chapter 5 for the handling procedures after the methodology is  approved).  The procedures of JCM projects and the JCM Project Cycle, including methodology development, are  aligned with each other while they are implemented in parallel as different processes. Thus, the project  proponent should keep the following points in mind when carrying out the activities:   Share with the supporting organization the progress of the project   Provide the supporting organization with necessary information and technical advice   Communicate sufficiently with joint business operators and the supporting organization (see the  boxes below for details)",

    "（４） Net emission reduction  Difference between BaU (business as usual) emissions and reference emissions is called net emission  reduction. Setting reference emissions so that net emission reduction can be ensured verifies the  substantive reduction of GHG emissions in JCM projects (see the column on the next page for details).  In JCM, as explained above, emission reduction is conservatively calculated while paying attention to  ensuring sufficient net emission reduction; consequently, there are many cases where the emission  reduction is lower than originally expected in projects, resulting in fewer credits that can be acquired.  Project proponents who will participate in JCM are advised to fully understand this. The detailed  methods of calculating emission reduction will be explained at the stage of application for a project.  Supporting organizations will explain about the methods again at the stage of methodology  development after your proposal is adopted as a project of Financing Programme for JCM Model  Projects; they will also support project proponents in developing their methodology in more detail.  *See the Guidebook (Collection of Cases) for specific cases of calculating reference emissions.",
