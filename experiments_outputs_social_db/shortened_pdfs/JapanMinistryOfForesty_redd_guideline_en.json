    "REDD-plus has become one of the major topics of discussion in the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This is because REDD-plus has a huge potential for  reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in developing countries, and is also expected to  contribute to sustainable forest management respecting safeguards in developing countries.  While international discussions and negotiations have been continuously taking place,  deforestation and forest degradation is increasing worldwide. Thus, early REDD-plus actions such  as readiness activities should be placed on the highest priority. Practices and experiences gained  from such early actions are sure to contribute to developing a framework for REDD-plus.  Being funded by the Japanese Forestry Agency, the REDD Research and Development Center,  which was established in the Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute of Japan in 2010, has  been conducting research and development to build a framework for REDD-plus, taking ongoing  international discussions into account.  Japan proposed a Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) as a way to leverage Japan’s contribution  to reduction of GHG emissions around the world. However, as to how to implement REDD-plus  activities under the JCM remains under discussion. The Center has been developing these  guidelines as one of our research activities aiming at facilitating the discussion about REDD-plus  projects to be implemented under the JCM.  We hope that REDD-plus activities will be implemented under the JCM and contribute to  facilitating REDD-plus activities on the ground, developing a new framework for REDD-plus and  mitigating climate change.",
