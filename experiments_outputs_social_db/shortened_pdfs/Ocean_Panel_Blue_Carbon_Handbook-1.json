    "22   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy The Paris Agreement:   Contextual policymaking The protection and recovery of blue carbon ecosystems  requires global and local efforts to maximise their contri- bution to climate mitigation and adaptation. Prioritising  blue carbon ecosystem protection for climate action,  biodiversity and sustainable development benefits is  demonstrated across all of the frameworks and relevant  national reports noted in Table 2. This section specifically  looks at how blue carbon can be viewed through a UNF- CCC lens to support Parties’ achievement of the goals of  the Paris Agreement through their associated NDCs (UN  2015a), and how Parties can utilise either market-based  or non-market approaches to provide resources nec- essary for successful action. An NDC is one of the main  components that drive ambition and implementation of  the Paris Agreement and can be viewed as a country’s cli- mate action plan. The NDCs allow each country to define  the nature and scope of its commitments, including  mitigation, adaptation, resilience priorities and long-term  low-emissions planning based on its national context.  While the NDC demonstrates national commitments and  targets at a high level, it is informed and underpinned  by a series of other national reports, such as national  adaptation plans (NAPs), national inventory reports  (technical details of the national GHG inventory), biennial  transparency reports (BTRs) or national biodiversity  strategy and action plans (NBSAPs). The flexibility of the  NDC architecture aligns well with the complexities of blue  carbon ecosystems.  The Paris Agreement provides a comparable framework  for countries to account for their emissions and mitiga- tion actions, as well as highlighting the other adaptation  benefits of blue carbon ecosystem protection. The  biennial transparency reports provide a more detailed  account of indicators and comparable metrics for mitiga- tion action, and start to capture adaptation co-benefits.  For example, countries that have a GHG mitigation target  in their NDC that is inclusive of the land sector, including  blue carbon ecosystems, must ensure that their national  GHG inventories accurately report emissions and remov- als from these ecosystems. Additional information on  the national GHG inventories and the BTR as it relates to  NDCs can be found in the section ‘The role for national  and subnational government action to enable and sup- port conservation and restoration of blue carbon’. Prioritisation of the protection of blue carbon ecosystems  is also a critical way to demonstrate enhanced climate  ambition in the context of a country’s adaptation and  resilience targets within the NDC or NAP. Relevant adap- tation priorities noted in current NDCs include but are not  limited to ecosystem-based adaptation approaches, sus- tainable fisheries and small-scale fisheries, and improved  livelihoods for coastal communities.  Article 6 of the Paris Agreement may also have direct  implications for the development of carbon markets,  including potential blue carbon projects. Article 6 sets out  modalities and rules to enable countries to cooperate to  achieve their NDCs through both market and non-mar- ket approaches (Granziera et al. 2023). Although most  rules around Article 6 were decided at COP 26 and COP  27, countries are still taking the early steps in develop- ing national approaches to enable Article 6 trades and  balancing the financial opportunities of markets with the  impacts that exporting carbon credits might have on their  NDCs (Granziera et al. 2023) (see section ‘Carbon market  opportunities and risks’). Detailed examples and guidance on how a country could  use a stepwise approach to include blue carbon elements  in its NDC for mitigation or adaptation can be found in  the ‘Key resources’ section, particularly the Blue Carbon  Initiative’s Guidelines on Enhanced Action: A Guide on How  Countries May Include Blue Carbon in Their Nationally  Determined Contributions.",

    "26   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy Select opportunities and  actionable policy options for  national and subnational  governments  NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS  A critical role for national governments is to provide clear  and permanent policy signals, align funding streams  and build the right incentive structure. Establishing clear  policy signals, through area-based management tools  such as sustainable ocean plans (SOPs) and marine  spatial planning, can also help to resolve many of the  conflicts mentioned above and provide clarity on govern- ment priorities2. Regulatory incentives: National governments can pro- vide regulatory incentives to encourage the restoration of  blue carbon ecosystems. For example, where land tenure  is clear and legal frameworks allow for this,  governments  may be able to provide regulatory (and tax) relief or  exemptions to landowners who restore or conserve blue  carbon ecosystems. Financial incentives: As knowledge of the economic,  environmental and social value is often missing or  sidelined by policies that treat the destruction of natural  capital as an externality, it is important for governments  to create frameworks for blue sustainable investments  and taxonomies, while also incentivising targeted blue  carbon ecosystem restoration and conservation through  subsidies or tax credits for businesses investing in  restoration projects. In this context, it is also crucial to  consistently replace harmful subsidies (those that encour- age the destruction or removal of existing blue carbon  ecosystems) with incentives for regenerative and sustain- able activities. Carbon-pricing mechanisms (see section  ‘Carbon market opportunities and risks‘) are important,  as are alternative funding and finance opportunities (see  section ‘Alternative funding and finance opportunities for  blue carbon’). Governments also need to create opportu- nities and incentives for blended-financing options that  incorporate sustainable and scalable investments for  coastal ecosystem protection and rehabilitation actions.  Finally, governments can also establish payment for  ecosystem services (PES) programs to reward landowners  and communities for the ecological services provided  by restored blue carbon ecosystems. PES programs can  provide financial incentives for restoration projects while  also offering benefits to local communities. Funding for research and knowledge development:  National public funding and research grants are crucial in  bridging knowledge gaps. The funding should be directed  towards policies set nationally and internationally to  ensure their effective implementation. Prioritising fund- ing for national agencies and laboratories within budgets  to enhance technical expertise and capacity is crucial for  governments to integrate blue carbon into their policies  and strategies, including NDCs, NBSAPs and LTS. Align- ment with subnational funding and activities also creates  opportunities to scale. Global and regional peer exchange: National gov- ernments are well suited to contribute to regional and  global coalitions, partnerships and opportunities for peer  exchange (see section ‘International partnerships and  other initiatives’). These offer the opportunity for access  to leading technical guidance but also serve as a platform  to share lessons and best practices from governments in  a similar position (see section ‘International partnerships  and other initiatives’). Build community awareness and support: National  governments can launch awareness campaigns to build  the social license for protecting and restoring blue carbon  ecosystems and increase the number of stakeholders  actively engaged in efforts and projects. Short-term opportunities for national decision-makers:  \t Assess national blue carbon opportunities including  area extent, ecosystem health, threats, carbon stores,  ecological importance and socioeconomic depen- dence of local communities. \t Develop a comprehensive blue carbon assessment by  estimating coastal carbon stocks and rates of change  over the last 10 years. Also, estimate emissions from  conversion activities to create tier 2 emission factors."

    "The blue carbon handbook: Blue carbon as a nature-based solution for climate action and sustainable development   |   33 Key information \t Coastal communities are often the first to recognise and value the services that healthy  coastal ecosystems provide beyond carbon sequestration, such as food provision, cli- mate and natural hazard protection, erosion regulation and sociocultural services.  \t Blue carbon ecosystems and local communities rely on each other, and are particularly  critical for gender equity. Promoting women’s participation in implementation does not  imply changing culture or customs but ensuring that women have a voice. \t While local communities are vital actors in successful nature-based solution projects,  including blue carbon, it is essential that steps be taken by project developers or policy- makers to safeguard local communities against potentially negative consequences in  the following ways: \t Ensure and identify clear legal pathways to enable them to secure land tenure or  management rights to their natural assets.  \t Carefully follow free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) procedures. \t Co-develop social safeguards and relevant systems for responsible implementation. \t Ensure that transparent legal frameworks are in place for local participation  and leadership, including benefit-sharing, to avoid political uncertainty and  gain consensus. \t Build capacity at all levels as necessary. Current status Indigenous People and local communi- ties (IPLCs, individuals and groups who  maintain an intergenerational historical connection to  place and nature through livelihoods, cultural identity,  languages, worldviews, institutions and ecological  knowledge (IPBES 2020)) play a key role as stewards of  the marine and coastal environment, managing its nat- ural resources sustainably in line with cultural traditions  (Vierros 2017). Coastal communities are often the first to recognise the  value of healthy coastal ecosystems (including natural  hazard protection, sociocultural services and food pro- vision), beyond carbon sequestration. Local knowledge  is crucial to developing and implementing sustainable  blue carbon actions at all levels, from the local to the  international. Implementation requires engaging and  empowering communities to integrate their valuable  insights considering local context, including cultural  norms, gender dynamics, resource use, land tenure and  governance structures (Lauer and Aswani 2010; Loch and  Riechers 2021). Women often rely on fisheries associated  with blue carbon ecosystems to feed their families, as  these can be accessed on foot without the need for a boat  (Bosold 2012). The integration of a gender perspective  is vital to the success of blue carbon initiatives and to  achieve more effective and sustainable results (Bosold  2012). Promoting women’s participation does not mean  changing culture and local customs but rather ensuring  that women have a voice (Bosold 2012).",

    "60   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy social and environmental safeguards can help to identify  and mitigate any negative impacts of carbon projects on  local communities. Q: What is a safeguard information system, and how  do I develop one? A: A safeguard information system (SIS) is a tool to mon- itor and evaluate the potential social and environmental  impacts of government policies and programs. While an  SIS is often required at a jurisdictional or landscape scale,  smaller-scale and/or voluntary projects would also benefit  from developing clarity and systems for safeguards.  Specifically, an SIS is designed to identify potential risks  and provide mitigation measures to ensure that these  policies and programs do not harm people or the envi- ronment. Developing an effective SIS requires a thorough  understanding of the contexts in which policies and  programs will operate, as well as the potential risks and  benefits associated with implementation. Key components  of a successful SIS include clear indicators, measurable  targets, and effective monitoring and reporting mecha- nisms. In order to develop an SIS that meets the needs  of your specific context, it is essential to engage with  stakeholders, including local communities, civil soci- ety organisations and relevant government agencies, to  ensure that their perspectives are taken into account. National implementation Q: My government department is new to blue carbon— where do I start?  A: The popularity of the term blue carbon may be over- whelming, and the breadth of information and uncertainty  that surrounds some of these discussions may seem  daunting, so the first step is to find out if it is relevant  to you. First, although the term is used frequently, blue  carbon is referring actionable ecosystems like mangroves,  seagrass meadows and tidal marshes. If these ecosystems  are present in country, the next step is to identify whether  there are current data on their location, spatial distri- bution, historical changes, knowledge of the ecosystem  services these ecosystems are providing, social interac- tions and the pressures and threats to those ecosystems.  These data may be available from another government  department or from NGOs. Once this is understood, the  next step is considering whether further science and  research are required. This may lead to further science  through a mapping of the blue carbon ecosystems in  your territory.  Second, the government department may consider  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems. This  requires undertaking a cost-benefit analysis, includ- ing understanding the financial implications of such a  commitment. On the one hand, these ecosystems are  important in terms of the benefits they provide to the local  communities, in terms of livelihoods, protecting coastal  areas and supporting economic sectors, such as fisheries  and tourism. On the other hand, protecting these ecosys- tems may curtail other activities, such as aquaculture  development. The department may also take into consid- eration global opportunities to position itself as a global  leader on blue carbon. Hence, governments will have to  undertake the delicate balancing exercise between conser- vation and development based on a cost-benefit analysis.  From here, the next steps include thinking about whether  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems requires  a specific policy or whether this is already addressed in  other policy documents. The government department may  need to engage with other government departments to  understand how to implement such a policy. A government  department must also think about the financial implica- tions and opportunities this aspiration entails. This may  lead to the creation of a new policy document and explora- tion and development of financing options."

Plan Vivo Focuses on community-based projects aimed at sustainable land use and livelihood  development.  UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM) Allows developed countries to invest in emission-reduction projects in developing  countries as a way to meet their own emission-reduction targets. The CDM covers a wide  range of project types, including afforestation and reforestation activities, and these  projects can generate certified emission reductions, which can be traded and used to offset  emissions in compliance markets. Gold Standard Goes beyond emission reductions to address sustainable development and environmental  integrity. It is well known for its focus on renewable energy projects but also covers  afforestation initiatives. It provides rigorous criteria related to project design, stakeholder  engagement, environmental safeguards and social co-benefits.  v2.0; upcoming methodology around seascapes), Plan  Vivo (afforestation, REDD+), the UNFCCC Clean Devel- opment Mechanism (afforestation and reforestation),  and the Gold Standard (afforestation) (Table 4). Verra is  developing additional methodologies for the storage of  blue carbon in seascapes. France recently approved a  methodology to generate blue carbon credits from the  protection of Posidonia seagrass meadows for use under  its domestic offsetting label Bas-Carbone, with the first  projects in the pipeline (République française 2023). The  European Union is preparing a regulatory framework  for the certification of carbon removals, including from  natural carbon removal activities, such as in wetlands,  potentially leading to the establishment of an EU-wide  voluntary removal carbon market. Current pipeline of blue carbon  credit or mitigation outcomes In 2021 about 970,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equiva- lent (tCO2e) were issued by the Verra Standard from blue  carbon projects (Jones 2021). However, these projects  account for only about 10 of the 1,829 projects listed by  Verra (2023)8. The Plan Vivo Standard hosts the world’s  first blue carbon credit project, the 117-hectare (ha)  Mikoko Pamoja project from Kenya (Plan Vivo 2023),  and has recently added two other projects to its list, one  in Madagascar (Vanga project) and the other in Kenya  (Tahiry-Honko project). A little over 20 mangrove blue  carbon projects are at advanced stages of preparation  globally (Jones 2021), while around 120–150 blue carbon  credit projects are at early or very early stages of devel- opment globally, including in Kenya, Tanzania, Benin,  Cameroon, Madagascar, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, India,  Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines and Indone- sia9. For a detailed overview of the advanced global blue  carbon project pipeline status as of June 2022, see IFC  (2023) and this report’s ‘Key resources’. Observed and expected prices Reported prices for blue carbon credits range from $5  to $35 per tCO2e, with the upper end of the price range  being paid for mangrove restoration and afforestation or  reforestation (Zeng et al. 2021; IFC 2023). Some buyers  are willing to go above this price range for high-quality  blue carbon removal projects (see section ‘Developing  high-quality, high-impact blue carbon projects‘).

Nature finance literacy training is crucial for both  the public and financial sectors, and there is a need to  scale up blended finance to integrate commercial funding  with grants and technical assistance support (Vanderk- lift et al. 2022). Adaptation and resilience  metrics Effective impact assessment (i.e. evaluating the outcomes  and effects of an initiative) is critical to facilitate credible  investment. To ensure credible and effective assessments  for any financing mechanism, clear, consistent, and  robust metrics and indicators are necessary to ensure  monitoring and the tracking of progress reporting (see  section ‘Carbon market opportunities and risks‘). At the  same time the more traditional conservation community  would benefit from capacity building in business skills  and relevant support (Sumaila et al. 2021). Untapped multilateral funding As the need for greater finance from public funding  and multilateral development banks to support coastal  infrastructure and SDG 14 is increasingly recognised,  there is an opportunity to integrate blue carbon activities  in making the case for investments in development priori- ties (Thiele et al. 2021). Accordingly, highlighting the potential co-benefits and  synergies between blue carbon activities and devel- opment priorities, including SDG 14 targets, can make  a compelling case for securing increased finance from  public funding and multilateral development banks. It  involves demonstrating how investing in blue carbon  initiatives not only addresses environmental challenges  but also supports economic growth, social well-being  and the achievement of broader sustainable develop- ment objectives.",
    "48   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy While standards and methodologies for assessing blue  carbon ecosystem services as revenue streams are still  developing (Himes-Cornell et al. 2018), uncertainties  around land tenure and risk considerations have limited  engagement from traditional financiers (Vanderklift et al.  2022). Additionally, a lack of long-term funding sources  and investor exit opportunities has hindered explora- tion of alternative financing and funding approaches.  However, several emerging financing pathways are being  discussed and tested in multiple locations (UNEP 2021):  \t An effort to identify, develop and monetise blue  carbon ecosystem services (including livelihood  activities, such as mud crab husbandry and honey  production in mangroves) (Himes-Cornell et al. 2018).  These are often termed ‘co-benefits’ or ‘non-car- bon-benefits’ when they are in fact de facto core  ecosystem services. Nature (or biodiversity) certifi- cates and resilience credits are examples of emerging  concepts in this regard. \t The conscious integration of BNCACs into broader  coastal planning to increase access to finance (Thiele  et al. 2021). For instance, BNCACs can be aligned as  climate or biodiversity refugia alongside tourism  activities, artisanal and small-scale fisheries or mari- culture production, and clean energy projects. Under  this model, for example, a seaweed farm utilising  floating solar infrastructure may be located adjacent  to an MPA with mangroves, all jointly managed by the  local community and further supported by ecotourism  activities. Such an approach benefits from multiple  and diverse revenue streams as well as the potential  for cost savings. \t The framing of BNCACs as valuable blue infrastructure  (Thiele et al. 2021), providing services such as natural  water treatment. Such an approach could provide sig- nificantly cheaper and reliable access to finance than  traditional infrastructure investments, for instance  from development banks, while increasing long-term  ecosystem resilience and asset protection (with rele- vance to wind farms, for example). \t Integration of BNCACs into the wider scope of the  sustainable blue economy, with an emphasis on  innovation, entrepreneurship and use of modern  technologies (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The  development of marine clusters (i.e. collaborative  platforms focused on promoting and supporting  innovations related to marine resources) that integrate  blue bio-economy approaches and provide access to  needed science and research will be a critical part of  this integration. Key knowledge gaps  and emerging issues Nature finance literacy  and capacity There is a need to build capacity for nature finance at  every level, including municipal or state governments,  local communities, small-scale fishers, the international  community, and the public and private sectors (Sumaila  et al. 2021).

    "42   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy Many countries are in the process of establishing internal  or domestic rules on how to participate in these new  market approaches7. Though operationalisation will  take time, the tools are expected to have a significant  impact in driving carbon finance for action in the real  economy (Yu et al. 2021) and for nature restoration and  conservation. As pressures mounts for faster decar- bonisation, around 77 percent of new and updated  NDCs show support for participation in Article 6, with  almost 50 percent of countries stating a strong interest  (Michaelowa et al. 2021). Additionally, industry-wide global compliance carbon  credit markets exist, including the International Civil  Aviation Organization’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction  Scheme for International Aviation, as well as national  and subnational carbon credit markets for compliance.  Some compliance market opportunities include NbS  emission reductions, including through blue carbon  credits, but are still nascent in operation. The most  prevalent carbon credit markets, however, in terms of  traded annual volumes, are the independent voluntary  carbon markets where verified emission reductions are  exchanged, mainly to meet the voluntary net-zero 2050  targets of companies, municipalities and organisations.  The vast majority of traded emission reductions and  removals (as of April 2023) have been verified according  to Verra’s independent crediting Verified Carbon Stan- dard (71.5 percent), followed by the Gold Standard (16.6  percent), the American Carbon Registry (6.2 percent),  Climate Action Reserve (5.2 percent) and Plan Vivo (0.5  percent) (VCMI 2023).  Carbon credits standards operate as ‘baseline-and-credit’  instruments; they define approved methodologies to cal- culate in detail the ‘baseline’ greenhouse gas emissions  and issue credits when and after a project verifies that  climate change mitigation has been achieved compared  to this baseline. Carbon credits have a unique serial  number and are issued, tracked and cancelled by means  of an electronic registry. Carbon credits, used to offset  emissions on a voluntary basis, are often referred to as  ‘carbon offsets’. Specific mangrove, seagrass and coastal  wetland restoration–based blue carbon verification  methodologies are offered by various independent volun- tary carbon market standards like Verra (VM0007 REDD+  Methodology Framework (REDD+MF), v1.6; VM0033  Methodology for Tidal Wetland and Seagrass Restoration,",
    "The blue carbon handbook: Blue carbon as a nature-based solution for climate action and sustainable development   |   37 Key information \t Although not all projects will be suitable for market-based approaches, building the  enabling policy conditions for successful conservation or restoration projects by focus- ing on a resilience or sustainable development benefit can contribute to a project with  mitigation co-benefits. \t While carbon markets are an important tool to finance the protection or restoration  of blue carbon ecosystems and channel resources to local communities, they do not  replace the need to reduce GHG emissions. Corporate strategies and commitments  which include offsetting must be paired with a robust science-based decarbonisation  target or policy. \t According to the Blue Carbon High-Quality Principles document, which resulted  from a consultative process, the five core principles of high-quality projects are  safeguard nature; empower people; employ the best information, interventions and  carbon accounting practices; operate locally and contextually; and mobilise high-in- tegrity capital. \t An often-overlooked aspect of a high-quality blue carbon project is building trust with  local communities and other relevant stakeholders, including municipal governments  or small-scale fishing communities who live and work in the area. Current status The demand for blue carbon credits and  recognition of the value of blue carbon  ecosystems has grown significantly in recent years. The  overall size of the voluntary carbon market in 2021 was  more than US$1 billion annually (Ecosystem Marketplace  2021) and is projected to increase by a factor of 15 by  2030 and by 100 by 2050 (Blaufelder et al. 2021). While  blue carbon is currently a small slice of the carbon market  ‘pie’ (blue carbon credits made up 0.15 percent of all  credits issued by Verra in 2022 (Verra 2023)), blue carbon  finance has the potential to grow overall investment in  coastal and ocean nature-based solutions and resilience  (see ‘Carbon market opportunities and risks’). Government and other initiatives have provided scaling  opportunities but also attracted project developers who  may not produce scientifically robust methodologies  and equitable market-based projects. It is crucial that all  stakeholders align around a shared vision for high-quality  blue carbon that achieves lasting and meaningful results  for people, nature and the climate. The Blue Carbon  High-Quality Principles and Guidance document was  launched in November 2022 at UNFCCC COP 27 to provide  guardrails for defining and assessing project quality (Box  5) (Conservation International et al. 2022). The Principles,  while voluntary, aim to develop pathways to achieving  high-quality projects, and objective metrics around each  principle are being developed. The implementation of the High-Quality Blue Carbon  Principles and Guidance is valuable in efforts to address  climate mitigation and adaptation, and builds on the  experience of other nature-based programmes like  REDD+ (Conservation International et al. 2022). The  stated goal, in accordance with the Paris Agreement, is to  limit global warming to no greater than 1.5 degrees Cel- sius above pre-industrial levels. Investments that value",

Regional blue carbon coalitions and partnerships provide  better access to data, funding and expertise, while allow- ing for knowledge exchange and learning. Continued collaboration The global blue carbon space is abundant with partner- ships working on science, policy, project implementation  and finance. Engaging in ongoing collaboration with  partners at all levels is key to serving the needs of  countries, local communities and stakeholders, and  driving blue carbon action worldwide. This creates  trusted relationships and credible advice for communities  and governments. Capacity development Capacity development plays a key role in equipping  governments, scientists, practitioners and stakehold- ers with the necessary knowledge, skills and resources  to engage in blue carbon initiatives effectively. This  includes enhancing technical expertise in areas such as  blue carbon assessment methodologies, project design  and implementation, policy development and financing  mechanisms. Capacity development should also focus on  fostering collaboration, knowledge-sharing and learning  among different actors involved in blue carbon projects,  at both the global and regional levels. By investing in  capacity development, international partnerships can  strengthen their ability to support countries in imple- menting blue carbon–relevant policies and actions, and  foster innovation and entrepreneurship.",
    "The blue carbon handbook: Blue carbon as a nature-based solution for climate action and sustainable development   |   35 Addressing land tenure and  carbon rights It is important to note that projects involving nature,  including REDD+ projects, have historically faced com- plexities regarding land tenure and have sometimes  resulted in the eviction or marginalisation of IPLCs (Rights  and Resources Initiative and McGill University 2021).  The opposite can also be true when the needs of local  communities are fully taken into account, where REDD+  projects have laid the foundation and enabling conditions  necessary to help secure land tenure for IPLCs (Goldstein  2016). It is essential that blue carbon initiatives adhere  to international agreements and norms, including with  respect to FPIC, to empower communities and avoid past  social injustices. Additionally, project developers should  ensure that the necessary capacity and communication  channels are built to enable communities to be involved  with a project’s design from its inception. This can help  prevent instances of ‘land grabbing’ or ‘ocean grabbing’  by investment groups and project developers. Local leadership and equitable  benefit-sharing Project developers must prioritise community involve- ment in decision-making processes beyond simply  ‘checking the box’ to meet prescribed requirements  (Cheney et al. 2015). To achieve lasting outcomes, local  leadership and ownership of blue carbon projects can be  championed throughout all phases of development and  implementation (Beeston et al. 2020). Governments can  support this by promoting and facilitating communities’  participation in decision-making processes and bene- fit-sharing arrangements (Rakotomahazo et al. 2019).  This includes ensuring that legal frameworks are in place  to avoid political uncertainty and gain consensus while  building capacity at all levels. Rural coastal communities rely on blue carbon eco- systems for food and financial security, and they are  disproportionately impacted by limitations to coastal  resources resulting from blue carbon projects. To address  this, equitable and transparent benefit-sharing plans  must be developed in consultation with all relevant  stakeholders (Pham et al. 2013). Beyond policymaking,  governments can also support financial management  Box 4.

    "60   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy social and environmental safeguards can help to identify  and mitigate any negative impacts of carbon projects on  local communities. Q: What is a safeguard information system, and how  do I develop one? A: A safeguard information system (SIS) is a tool to mon- itor and evaluate the potential social and environmental  impacts of government policies and programs. While an  SIS is often required at a jurisdictional or landscape scale,  smaller-scale and/or voluntary projects would also benefit  from developing clarity and systems for safeguards.  Specifically, an SIS is designed to identify potential risks  and provide mitigation measures to ensure that these  policies and programs do not harm people or the envi- ronment. Developing an effective SIS requires a thorough  understanding of the contexts in which policies and  programs will operate, as well as the potential risks and  benefits associated with implementation. Key components  of a successful SIS include clear indicators, measurable  targets, and effective monitoring and reporting mecha- nisms. In order to develop an SIS that meets the needs  of your specific context, it is essential to engage with  stakeholders, including local communities, civil soci- ety organisations and relevant government agencies, to  ensure that their perspectives are taken into account. National implementation Q: My government department is new to blue carbon— where do I start?  A: The popularity of the term blue carbon may be over- whelming, and the breadth of information and uncertainty  that surrounds some of these discussions may seem  daunting, so the first step is to find out if it is relevant  to you. First, although the term is used frequently, blue  carbon is referring actionable ecosystems like mangroves,  seagrass meadows and tidal marshes. If these ecosystems  are present in country, the next step is to identify whether  there are current data on their location, spatial distri- bution, historical changes, knowledge of the ecosystem  services these ecosystems are providing, social interac- tions and the pressures and threats to those ecosystems.  These data may be available from another government  department or from NGOs. Once this is understood, the  next step is considering whether further science and  research are required. This may lead to further science  through a mapping of the blue carbon ecosystems in  your territory.  Second, the government department may consider  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems. This  requires undertaking a cost-benefit analysis, includ- ing understanding the financial implications of such a  commitment. On the one hand, these ecosystems are  important in terms of the benefits they provide to the local  communities, in terms of livelihoods, protecting coastal  areas and supporting economic sectors, such as fisheries  and tourism. On the other hand, protecting these ecosys- tems may curtail other activities, such as aquaculture  development. The department may also take into consid- eration global opportunities to position itself as a global  leader on blue carbon. Hence, governments will have to  undertake the delicate balancing exercise between conser- vation and development based on a cost-benefit analysis.  From here, the next steps include thinking about whether  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems requires  a specific policy or whether this is already addressed in  other policy documents. The government department may  need to engage with other government departments to  understand how to implement such a policy. A government  department must also think about the financial implica- tions and opportunities this aspiration entails. This may  lead to the creation of a new policy document and explora- tion and development of financing options.",

Verra is  developing additional methodologies for the storage of  blue carbon in seascapes. France recently approved a  methodology to generate blue carbon credits from the  protection of Posidonia seagrass meadows for use under  its domestic offsetting label Bas-Carbone, with the first  projects in the pipeline (République française 2023). The  European Union is preparing a regulatory framework  for the certification of carbon removals, including from  natural carbon removal activities, such as in wetlands,  potentially leading to the establishment of an EU-wide  voluntary removal carbon market. Current pipeline of blue carbon  credit or mitigation outcomes In 2021 about 970,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equiva- lent (tCO2e) were issued by the Verra Standard from blue  carbon projects (Jones 2021). However, these projects  account for only about 10 of the 1,829 projects listed by  Verra (2023)8. The Plan Vivo Standard hosts the world’s  first blue carbon credit project, the 117-hectare (ha)  Mikoko Pamoja project from Kenya (Plan Vivo 2023),  and has recently added two other projects to its list, one  in Madagascar (Vanga project) and the other in Kenya  (Tahiry-Honko project). A little over 20 mangrove blue  carbon projects are at advanced stages of preparation  globally (Jones 2021), while around 120–150 blue carbon  credit projects are at early or very early stages of devel- opment globally, including in Kenya, Tanzania, Benin,  Cameroon, Madagascar, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, India,  Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines and Indone- sia9. For a detailed overview of the advanced global blue  carbon project pipeline status as of June 2022, see IFC  (2023) and this report’s ‘Key resources’. Observed and expected prices Reported prices for blue carbon credits range from $5  to $35 per tCO2e, with the upper end of the price range  being paid for mangrove restoration and afforestation or  reforestation (Zeng et al. 2021; IFC 2023).

Prioritising  blue carbon ecosystem protection for climate action,  biodiversity and sustainable development benefits is  demonstrated across all of the frameworks and relevant  national reports noted in Table 2. This section specifically  looks at how blue carbon can be viewed through a UNF- CCC lens to support Parties’ achievement of the goals of  the Paris Agreement through their associated NDCs (UN  2015a), and how Parties can utilise either market-based  or non-market approaches to provide resources nec- essary for successful action. An NDC is one of the main  components that drive ambition and implementation of  the Paris Agreement and can be viewed as a country’s cli- mate action plan. The NDCs allow each country to define  the nature and scope of its commitments, including  mitigation, adaptation, resilience priorities and long-term  low-emissions planning based on its national context.  While the NDC demonstrates national commitments and  targets at a high level, it is informed and underpinned  by a series of other national reports, such as national  adaptation plans (NAPs), national inventory reports  (technical details of the national GHG inventory), biennial  transparency reports (BTRs) or national biodiversity  strategy and action plans (NBSAPs). The flexibility of the  NDC architecture aligns well with the complexities of blue  carbon ecosystems.  The Paris Agreement provides a comparable framework  for countries to account for their emissions and mitiga- tion actions, as well as highlighting the other adaptation  benefits of blue carbon ecosystem protection. The  biennial transparency reports provide a more detailed  account of indicators and comparable metrics for mitiga- tion action, and start to capture adaptation co-benefits.  For example, countries that have a GHG mitigation target  in their NDC that is inclusive of the land sector, including  blue carbon ecosystems, must ensure that their national  GHG inventories accurately report emissions and remov- als from these ecosystems. Additional information on  the national GHG inventories and the BTR as it relates to  NDCs can be found in the section ‘The role for national  and subnational government action to enable and sup- port conservation and restoration of blue carbon’. Prioritisation of the protection of blue carbon ecosystems  is also a critical way to demonstrate enhanced climate  ambition in the context of a country’s adaptation and  resilience targets within the NDC or NAP. Relevant adap- tation priorities noted in current NDCs include but are not  limited to ecosystem-based adaptation approaches, sus- tainable fisheries and small-scale fisheries, and improved  livelihoods for coastal communities.  Article 6 of the Paris Agreement may also have direct  implications for the development of carbon markets,  including potential blue carbon projects. Article 6 sets out  modalities and rules to enable countries to cooperate to  achieve their NDCs through both market and non-mar- ket approaches (Granziera et al. 2023). Although most  rules around Article 6 were decided at COP 26 and COP  27, countries are still taking the early steps in develop- ing national approaches to enable Article 6 trades and  balancing the financial opportunities of markets with the  impacts that exporting carbon credits might have on their  NDCs (Granziera et al. 2023) (see section ‘Carbon market  opportunities and risks’). Detailed examples and guidance on how a country could  use a stepwise approach to include blue carbon elements  in its NDC for mitigation or adaptation can be found in  the ‘Key resources’ section, particularly the Blue Carbon  Initiative’s Guidelines on Enhanced Action: A Guide on How  Countries May Include Blue Carbon in Their Nationally  Determined Contributions."

    "The blue carbon handbook: Blue carbon as a nature-based solution for climate action and sustainable development   |   41 Key information \t The demand for high-quality blue carbon projects and related carbon assets (e.g. blue  carbon credits) has been growing over the past years. It is currently driven by compa- nies’ and non-state actors’ voluntary net-zero emission plans as well as by consumer  emission-compensation pursuits, and should have strong safeguards to ensure  climate justice. \t The supply potential of blue carbon credits is favourable. Prices that buyers or investors  are willing to pay for blue carbon credits are reaching levels that can cover the costs of  many restoration and conservation initiatives in ecosystems rich in blue carbon. \t Barriers to the realisation of the potential of blue carbon credits and natural assets  include high start-up and feasibility costs; limited measurement, reporting and verifi- cation capacity; concerns about uncertainty risks for project continued operation; and  the need for an investable project pipeline. \t Up to 20 percent of mangrove forest conservation projects (2.5 million hectares) could  potentially qualify for blue carbon market participation. Given the high demand, blue  carbon credits could be worth more than US$10 billion5.  Current status Overview of relevant  market opportunities Carbon markets have been operating for about 25 years  and have delivered finance for emission-reduction and  removal projects around the globe. Since 2007, 4.7 giga- tonnes CO2e of carbon credits—where 1 credit is equal to  1 tonne CO2e of reduced or removed emissions (‘emission  reduction’)—have been issued, and 478 million carbon  credits were issued from international, domestic and  independent carbon credit markets in 2021 alone (World  Bank 2022). Removals and emission reductions from  protecting or restoring blue carbon ecosystems are a rel- atively nascent component within the broader financing  mechanism—with approximately 970,000 carbon credits  being issued by the Verra Standard from blue carbon  projects in 2021 (Jones 2021). In 1997, the UNFCCC Kyoto Protocol introduced the first  global carbon compliance market for allocated emission  allowances (under the cap-and-trade system) and carbon  credits (under the baseline-and-credit system)6. More  recently, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement (PA) and its  Glasgow Climate Pact have established guidance, modal- ities and rules for using international market approaches  to support the achievement of countries’ NDCs (UN  2015a). Article 6 includes approaches for exchanging  international mitigation outcomes under ‘coopera- tive approaches’ (PA Article 6.2) and sets up a new  emission-reduction crediting and trading mechanism  supervised by the UNFCCC (PA Article. 6.4), both allowing  the participation of companies. Cooperative implementa- tion through carbon markets compatible with PA Article  6 may enable countries to achieve their NDC targets with  greater economic efficiency while channelling climate  funding to the selling countries.",

Establishing clear  policy signals, through area-based management tools  such as sustainable ocean plans (SOPs) and marine  spatial planning, can also help to resolve many of the  conflicts mentioned above and provide clarity on govern- ment priorities2. Regulatory incentives: National governments can pro- vide regulatory incentives to encourage the restoration of  blue carbon ecosystems. For example, where land tenure  is clear and legal frameworks allow for this,  governments  may be able to provide regulatory (and tax) relief or  exemptions to landowners who restore or conserve blue  carbon ecosystems. Financial incentives: As knowledge of the economic,  environmental and social value is often missing or  sidelined by policies that treat the destruction of natural  capital as an externality, it is important for governments  to create frameworks for blue sustainable investments  and taxonomies, while also incentivising targeted blue  carbon ecosystem restoration and conservation through  subsidies or tax credits for businesses investing in  restoration projects. In this context, it is also crucial to  consistently replace harmful subsidies (those that encour- age the destruction or removal of existing blue carbon  ecosystems) with incentives for regenerative and sustain- able activities. Carbon-pricing mechanisms (see section  ‘Carbon market opportunities and risks‘) are important,  as are alternative funding and finance opportunities (see  section ‘Alternative funding and finance opportunities for  blue carbon’). Governments also need to create opportu- nities and incentives for blended-financing options that  incorporate sustainable and scalable investments for  coastal ecosystem protection and rehabilitation actions.  Finally, governments can also establish payment for  ecosystem services (PES) programs to reward landowners  and communities for the ecological services provided  by restored blue carbon ecosystems. PES programs can  provide financial incentives for restoration projects while  also offering benefits to local communities. Funding for research and knowledge development:  National public funding and research grants are crucial in  bridging knowledge gaps. The funding should be directed  towards policies set nationally and internationally to  ensure their effective implementation. Prioritising fund- ing for national agencies and laboratories within budgets  to enhance technical expertise and capacity is crucial for  governments to integrate blue carbon into their policies  and strategies, including NDCs, NBSAPs and LTS. Align- ment with subnational funding and activities also creates  opportunities to scale. Global and regional peer exchange: National gov- ernments are well suited to contribute to regional and  global coalitions, partnerships and opportunities for peer  exchange (see section ‘International partnerships and  other initiatives’). These offer the opportunity for access  to leading technical guidance but also serve as a platform  to share lessons and best practices from governments in  a similar position (see section ‘International partnerships  and other initiatives’). Build community awareness and support: National  governments can launch awareness campaigns to build  the social license for protecting and restoring blue carbon  ecosystems and increase the number of stakeholders  actively engaged in efforts and projects. Short-term opportunities for national decision-makers:  \t Assess national blue carbon opportunities including  area extent, ecosystem health, threats, carbon stores,  ecological importance and socioeconomic depen- dence of local communities. \t Develop a comprehensive blue carbon assessment by  estimating coastal carbon stocks and rates of change  over the last 10 years. Also, estimate emissions from  conversion activities to create tier 2 emission factors."

    "60   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy social and environmental safeguards can help to identify  and mitigate any negative impacts of carbon projects on  local communities. Q: What is a safeguard information system, and how  do I develop one? A: A safeguard information system (SIS) is a tool to mon- itor and evaluate the potential social and environmental  impacts of government policies and programs. While an  SIS is often required at a jurisdictional or landscape scale,  smaller-scale and/or voluntary projects would also benefit  from developing clarity and systems for safeguards.  Specifically, an SIS is designed to identify potential risks  and provide mitigation measures to ensure that these  policies and programs do not harm people or the envi- ronment. Developing an effective SIS requires a thorough  understanding of the contexts in which policies and  programs will operate, as well as the potential risks and  benefits associated with implementation. Key components  of a successful SIS include clear indicators, measurable  targets, and effective monitoring and reporting mecha- nisms. In order to develop an SIS that meets the needs  of your specific context, it is essential to engage with  stakeholders, including local communities, civil soci- ety organisations and relevant government agencies, to  ensure that their perspectives are taken into account. National implementation Q: My government department is new to blue carbon— where do I start?  A: The popularity of the term blue carbon may be over- whelming, and the breadth of information and uncertainty  that surrounds some of these discussions may seem  daunting, so the first step is to find out if it is relevant  to you. First, although the term is used frequently, blue  carbon is referring actionable ecosystems like mangroves,  seagrass meadows and tidal marshes. If these ecosystems  are present in country, the next step is to identify whether  there are current data on their location, spatial distri- bution, historical changes, knowledge of the ecosystem  services these ecosystems are providing, social interac- tions and the pressures and threats to those ecosystems.  These data may be available from another government  department or from NGOs. Once this is understood, the  next step is considering whether further science and  research are required. This may lead to further science  through a mapping of the blue carbon ecosystems in  your territory.  Second, the government department may consider  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems. This  requires undertaking a cost-benefit analysis, includ- ing understanding the financial implications of such a  commitment. On the one hand, these ecosystems are  important in terms of the benefits they provide to the local  communities, in terms of livelihoods, protecting coastal  areas and supporting economic sectors, such as fisheries  and tourism. On the other hand, protecting these ecosys- tems may curtail other activities, such as aquaculture  development. The department may also take into consid- eration global opportunities to position itself as a global  leader on blue carbon. Hence, governments will have to  undertake the delicate balancing exercise between conser- vation and development based on a cost-benefit analysis.  From here, the next steps include thinking about whether  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems requires  a specific policy or whether this is already addressed in  other policy documents. The government department may  need to engage with other government departments to  understand how to implement such a policy. A government  department must also think about the financial implica- tions and opportunities this aspiration entails. This may  lead to the creation of a new policy document and explora- tion and development of financing options."

    "60   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy social and environmental safeguards can help to identify  and mitigate any negative impacts of carbon projects on  local communities. Q: What is a safeguard information system, and how  do I develop one? A: A safeguard information system (SIS) is a tool to mon- itor and evaluate the potential social and environmental  impacts of government policies and programs. While an  SIS is often required at a jurisdictional or landscape scale,  smaller-scale and/or voluntary projects would also benefit  from developing clarity and systems for safeguards.  Specifically, an SIS is designed to identify potential risks  and provide mitigation measures to ensure that these  policies and programs do not harm people or the envi- ronment. Developing an effective SIS requires a thorough  understanding of the contexts in which policies and  programs will operate, as well as the potential risks and  benefits associated with implementation. Key components  of a successful SIS include clear indicators, measurable  targets, and effective monitoring and reporting mecha- nisms. In order to develop an SIS that meets the needs  of your specific context, it is essential to engage with  stakeholders, including local communities, civil soci- ety organisations and relevant government agencies, to  ensure that their perspectives are taken into account. National implementation Q: My government department is new to blue carbon— where do I start?  A: The popularity of the term blue carbon may be over- whelming, and the breadth of information and uncertainty  that surrounds some of these discussions may seem  daunting, so the first step is to find out if it is relevant  to you. First, although the term is used frequently, blue  carbon is referring actionable ecosystems like mangroves,  seagrass meadows and tidal marshes. If these ecosystems  are present in country, the next step is to identify whether  there are current data on their location, spatial distri- bution, historical changes, knowledge of the ecosystem  services these ecosystems are providing, social interac- tions and the pressures and threats to those ecosystems.  These data may be available from another government  department or from NGOs. Once this is understood, the  next step is considering whether further science and  research are required. This may lead to further science  through a mapping of the blue carbon ecosystems in  your territory.  Second, the government department may consider  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems. This  requires undertaking a cost-benefit analysis, includ- ing understanding the financial implications of such a  commitment. On the one hand, these ecosystems are  important in terms of the benefits they provide to the local  communities, in terms of livelihoods, protecting coastal  areas and supporting economic sectors, such as fisheries  and tourism. On the other hand, protecting these ecosys- tems may curtail other activities, such as aquaculture  development. The department may also take into consid- eration global opportunities to position itself as a global  leader on blue carbon. Hence, governments will have to  undertake the delicate balancing exercise between conser- vation and development based on a cost-benefit analysis.  From here, the next steps include thinking about whether  conserving or restoring blue carbon ecosystems requires  a specific policy or whether this is already addressed in  other policy documents. The government department may  need to engage with other government departments to  understand how to implement such a policy. A government  department must also think about the financial implica- tions and opportunities this aspiration entails. This may  lead to the creation of a new policy document and explora- tion and development of financing options.",

    "26   |   High Level Panel for a Sustainable Ocean Economy Select opportunities and  actionable policy options for  national and subnational  governments  NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS  A critical role for national governments is to provide clear  and permanent policy signals, align funding streams  and build the right incentive structure. Establishing clear  policy signals, through area-based management tools  such as sustainable ocean plans (SOPs) and marine  spatial planning, can also help to resolve many of the  conflicts mentioned above and provide clarity on govern- ment priorities2. Regulatory incentives: National governments can pro- vide regulatory incentives to encourage the restoration of  blue carbon ecosystems. For example, where land tenure  is clear and legal frameworks allow for this,  governments  may be able to provide regulatory (and tax) relief or  exemptions to landowners who restore or conserve blue  carbon ecosystems. Financial incentives: As knowledge of the economic,  environmental and social value is often missing or  sidelined by policies that treat the destruction of natural  capital as an externality, it is important for governments  to create frameworks for blue sustainable investments  and taxonomies, while also incentivising targeted blue  carbon ecosystem restoration and conservation through  subsidies or tax credits for businesses investing in  restoration projects. In this context, it is also crucial to  consistently replace harmful subsidies (those that encour- age the destruction or removal of existing blue carbon  ecosystems) with incentives for regenerative and sustain- able activities. Carbon-pricing mechanisms (see section  ‘Carbon market opportunities and risks‘) are important,  as are alternative funding and finance opportunities (see  section ‘Alternative funding and finance opportunities for  blue carbon’). Governments also need to create opportu- nities and incentives for blended-financing options that  incorporate sustainable and scalable investments for  coastal ecosystem protection and rehabilitation actions.  Finally, governments can also establish payment for  ecosystem services (PES) programs to reward landowners  and communities for the ecological services provided  by restored blue carbon ecosystems. PES programs can  provide financial incentives for restoration projects while  also offering benefits to local communities. Funding for research and knowledge development:  National public funding and research grants are crucial in  bridging knowledge gaps. The funding should be directed  towards policies set nationally and internationally to  ensure their effective implementation. Prioritising fund- ing for national agencies and laboratories within budgets  to enhance technical expertise and capacity is crucial for  governments to integrate blue carbon into their policies  and strategies, including NDCs, NBSAPs and LTS. Align- ment with subnational funding and activities also creates  opportunities to scale. Global and regional peer exchange: National gov- ernments are well suited to contribute to regional and  global coalitions, partnerships and opportunities for peer  exchange (see section ‘International partnerships and  other initiatives’). These offer the opportunity for access  to leading technical guidance but also serve as a platform  to share lessons and best practices from governments in  a similar position (see section ‘International partnerships  and other initiatives’). Build community awareness and support: National  governments can launch awareness campaigns to build  the social license for protecting and restoring blue carbon  ecosystems and increase the number of stakeholders  actively engaged in efforts and projects. Short-term opportunities for national decision-makers:  \t Assess national blue carbon opportunities including  area extent, ecosystem health, threats, carbon stores,  ecological importance and socioeconomic depen- dence of local communities. \t Develop a comprehensive blue carbon assessment by  estimating coastal carbon stocks and rates of change  over the last 10 years. Also, estimate emissions from  conversion activities to create tier 2 emission factors."
