    "This REDD+ Methodology Framework document is the basic structure of a modular REDD+  methodology. It provides the generic functionality of the methodology, which frames pre-defined  modules and tools that perform a specific function. It constitutes, together with the modules  and tools it calls upon, a complete REDD+ baseline and monitoring methodology.  The modules and tools called upon in this document are applicable to the following activities:   •  Avoiding unplanned deforestation (AUDef)  •  Avoiding planned deforestation (APDef)  •  Conservation of intact wetlands (CIW), which includes avoiding planned wetland  degradation (APWD) and avoiding unplanned wetland degradation (AUWD)  •  Restoring wetland ecosystems (RWE)  The reference to this methodology and the modules used to construct the project-specific  methodology must be given in the project description (PD).  Identification of the VCS-eligible Activity(ies)  To identify the type of VCS-eligible project activity, use the decision trees in Table 1 to Table 3  below. The decision trees must be used to provide a broad indication of likely baseline type and  applicability. Ultimately, the relevant baseline modules (BL-UP – avoiding unplanned  deforestation or wetland degradation; BL-PL – avoiding planned deforestation, planned  degradation, or planned wetland degradation;  BL-PEAT – peatland and BL-TW – tidal wetland)  must be applied with relevant applicability conditions and criteria.  Provide all the necessary evidence to demonstrate the type of eligible activity as given in each  module.   A project can include areas subject to different eligible activities (e.g., Area A = avoiding  planned deforestation, Area B = avoiding unplanned deforestation, Area C = reforestation, etc.).  In such cases the areas that are eligible for different categories must be captured by different  strata and clearly delineated (i.e., without spatial overlap), and the procedures outlined below  applied to each of them separately. Projects may be stand-alone REDD  and/or WRC. Projects  may combine WRC with REDD, in a single area, in which case they must apply concomitantly  the procedures for both categories provided in this methodology, unless, in the case of stand- alone REDD on wetlands, the expected emissions from the soil organic carbon pool or change  in the soil organic carbon pool in the project scenario is deemed de minimis, or, in the case of  stand-alone RWE with presence of vegetation, the expected emissions from the biomass pool or  change in the biomass pool in the project scenario is deemed de minimis. The tool T-SIG or  Appendix 1 must be used to justify the omission of carbon pools and emission sources.  The demonstration of eligibility must be reported in the PD."

    "VM0007, v1.8  46  •  Data from well-referenced peer-reviewed literature or other well-established published  sources21F21; or  •  National inventory data or default factors from IPCC literature that has, whenever  possible and necessary, been checked for consistency against available local data  specific to the project circumstances; or  •  In the absence of the above sources of information, expert opinion must be used to  assist with data selection. Experts will often provide a range of data, as well as a most  probable value for the data. The rationale for selecting a particular data value must be  briefly noted.  In choosing key parameters, or making important assumptions based on information that is not  specific to the project circumstances, such as in use of default factors, the project must select  values that will lead to an accurate estimation of net GHG emission reductions, taking into  account uncertainties.  If uncertainty is significant, the project must choose data such that it indisputably tends to under- estimate, rather than over-estimate, net GHG project benefits.  To ensure that GHG fluxes are estimated in a way that is accurate, verifiable, transparent, and  consistent across measurement periods, the project must establish and document clear standard  operating procedures and procedures for ensuring data quality. At a minimum, these procedures  must include:  •  Comprehensive documentation of all field measurements carried out in the project area.  This document must be detailed enough to allow replication of sampling in the event of  staff turnover between monitoring periods  •  Training procedures for all persons involved in field measurement or data analysis. The  scope and date of all training must be documented  •  A protocol for assessing the accuracy of plot measurements using a check cruise and a  plan for correcting the inventory if errors are discovered  •  Protocols for assessing data for outliers, transcription errors, and consistency across  measurement periods  •  Data sheets must be safely archived for the life of the project. Data stored in electronic  formats must be backed up",
    "VM0007, v1.8  47  Expert judgement  The use of expert judgment for the selection and interpretation of methods, selection of input  data to fill gaps in available data, and selection of data from a range of possible values or  uncertainty ranges, are all well established in the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance. Obtaining  well-informed judgments from domain experts regarding best estimates and uncertainties is an  important aspect in various procedures throughout this methodology. The project proponent must  use the guidance provided in Chapter 2 (Approaches to Data Collection), in particular, Section 2.2  and Annex 2A.1 of the IPCC 2006 good practice guidance.  Monitoring of Project Implementation  Information must be provided, and recorded, to establish that:  1) The geographic position of the project boundary is recorded for all areas of land. The  geographic coordinates of the project boundary (and any stratification or buffer zones  inside the boundary) are established, recorded and archived. This may be achieved by field  survey (e.g., using GPS), or by using georeferenced spatial data (e.g., maps, GIS datasets,  orthorectified aerial photography or georeferenced remote sensing images).  The above also applies to the recording of strata, including strata resulting from peatland  fires in the project scenario.  2) Commonly accepted principles of land use inventory and management are implemented.  •  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality control/quality assurance  (QA/QC) procedures for inventories including field data collection and data  management must be applied. Use or adaptation of SOPs already applied in  national land use monitoring, or available from published handbooks, or from the  latest IPCC guidance documents (GPG–LULUCF, Reporting Guidelines, is  recommended  •  Apply SOPs, especially for actions likely to cause peat disturbances  •  The project plan, together with a record of the plan as actually implemented during  the project must be available for validation or verification, as appropriate  For WRC project activities, continued compliance with the applicability conditions of this  methodology must be ensured by monitoring that:  •  The water table is not lowered except where the project converts open water to tidal  wetlands, or improves the hydrological connection to impounded waters  •  The burning of organic soil as a project activity does not occur  •  Peatland fires within the project area do not occur in the project scenario. If they do occur  as non-catastrophic events, they are accounted for by cancelling the Fire Reduction  Premium for the entire project or the individual project activity instance.",
    "Step 2b: Where the VT0001 investment analysis is used to demonstrate additionality, and if at  least one land use scenario generates financial benefits other than carbon revenues, select the  baseline scenario as below:    1) Where VT0001 Option I is used, the baseline scenario is the land use scenario with the  lowest costs over the crediting period). Option I may only be applied if the alternative  scenarios do not include revenues."
