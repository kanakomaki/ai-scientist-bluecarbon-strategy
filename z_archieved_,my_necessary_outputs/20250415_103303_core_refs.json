Blue frontiers: managing the environmental costs of aquaculture\nAuthors: Hall, S.J., Delaporte, A., Phillips, M.J., Beveridge, M., O'Keefe, M.\nYear: 2011-01-01\nAbstract: The report begins with an overview of the current status of world aquaculture. It then goes on to describe an approach for estimating the current combined biophysical resource demands of aquaculture for producer countries and regions. Following a comparison of these results with those available for other animal food productio"

Blue carbon ecosystems such as mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes have attracted particular attention for their ability to sequester and store carbon at densities that can far exceed o"

D., Fourqurean, James W\nYear: 2019-03-07\nAbstract: Calcium carbonates (CaCO3) often accumulate in mangrove and seagrass sediments. As CaCO3 production emits CO2, there is concern that this may partially offset the role of Blue Carbon ecosystems as CO2sinks through the burial of organic carb"
